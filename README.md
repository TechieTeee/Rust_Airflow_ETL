# Rust Airflow ETL

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a data transformation script written in Rust and its integration with Apache Airflow for scalable and efficient data processing. The Rust script performs data transformation, and Airflow is used to orchestrate and schedule the data processing pipeline. As Rust continues to grow in popularity, it will continue to play a larger role in data engineering.

## Rust Data Transformation

The Rust script (`src/main.rs`) is designed to transform data from one format to another. It leverages the performance and memory advantages of Rust to provide a fast and reliable data transformation process. You can customize the script based on your specific data transformation requirements.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TechieTeee/Rust_Airflow_ETL.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Rust_Airflow_ETL
    ```

3. Build and run the Rust script:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

## Importance of Rust in Data Engineering

Rust's emphasis on performance, memory safety, and zero-cost abstractions makes it a compelling choice for developing data engineering tools. While the current ecosystem might be limited compared to languages like Python, the advantages of Rust can significantly benefit ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines in terms of optimizing memory allocation and overall performance.

### Key Advantages:

- **Performance:** Rust's performance is comparable to low-level languages like C and C++, making it suitable for high-performance data processing tasks.

- **Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without sacrificing performance, reducing the risk of memory-related errors in data processing applications.

- **Concurrency:** Rust's ownership and borrowing system allows for safe and efficient concurrent programming, a crucial aspect of scalable data engineering.

- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Rust's focus on portability enables the development of cross-platform data engineering tools, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide suggestions to enhance the functionality and usability of the Rust data transformation and Airflow integration.
